Zenith framework aims to simplify the development of apps in Bun. It consists of a core packages, systems and `Blaze`.

The core packages provides everything that is needed to:
- automatically load every module in your project
- instanciate your classes
- provide injectable components (i.e. classes or values)

## Injection container & Orbs

Zenith uses an injection container and injected elements are called `orbs`.

An orb represents anything that you with to make auto-injectable and auto-injected in your code.

<Code code={`
@Orb()
export class MyService {
    someMethod() {
        return 'Hello, world !';
    }
}
`} lang="js" title="my.service.ts" />

<Code code={`
@Orb()
export class MyOtherService {
    // Dependencies automatically injected
    constructor(private readonly myService: MyService) {}

    realMethod() {
        return this.myService.someMethod();
    }
}
`} lang="js" title="my-other.service.ts"/>
