# Systems
<Aside>A system is a concept that is entangled in Zenith's life-cycle. It exposes Orbs and capabilities that enable modularity.</Aside>

When you want to aggregate some functionalities in the same place, systems are a good place to do so.

## Systems & zenith lifecycle

Zenith's lifecycle is as follows:
1. Provide Orb container (for dependency injection)
2. Prepare systems \
   a. call `system.init(container)` \
   b. load systems' orbs
3. Load project's orbs (your code)
4. Instanciate orbs
5. Runs (can hang here if a web server is started for example)
6. Shutdown \
   a. Stop systems \
   b. Stop zenith

## Creating a new system

You need at least 1 file to make a new system:

```ts title=my.system.ts
import type { ZenithSystem } from "@zenith-framework/core";

// It is important to use that interface, to correctly implement hooks
export class MySystem implements ZenithSystem {
   init(container: OrbContainer): void {}

   async onStart(): Promise<void> {}

   async onStop(): Promise<void> {}

   getPath(): string {
      // keep this one exactly that way. disclaimer: it will change very soon to be less boilerplate
        return import.meta.dirname;
   }
}
```
