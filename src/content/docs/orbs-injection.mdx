# Orbs
<Aside>An orb is a concept wrapping something that will be injectable, and injected anywhere.</Aside>

Zenith works with a injection container, that finds Orbs by scanning the modules present in your codebase.


## Orb scanning
The root of the scanner is your entry point, so if you have:
```sh
.
├─ src/
   ├─ index.ts (entrypoint)
   ├─ services/
      ├─ a.service.ts
      ├─ b.service.ts
```

Zenith will load `index.ts`, `a.service.ts`, `b.service.ts` and find orbs there.

The order of scanning is:
1. Zenith core modules
2. Zenith systems
3. Your code

## Orb injection

After scanning your modules, Zenith instanciates Orbs taking into account their dependencies.

As of today, orbs are instanciated as singletons, and these singletons are injected anywhere they're needed. Scopes / re-instanciation is not (yet) implemented.
